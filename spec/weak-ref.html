  <h1> WeakRef Objects </h1>
  <p>
    A WeakRef is an object that is used to refer to a target object
    without preserving it from garbage collection. WeakRefs can
    dereference to allow access to the target object, if the target
    object hasn't been reclaimed by garbage collection.

        is the initial value of the `WeakRef` property of the global

        constructors that intend to inherit the specified `WeakRef`
        behaviour must include a `super` call to the `WeakRef` constructor
        to create and initialize the subclass instance with the internal
