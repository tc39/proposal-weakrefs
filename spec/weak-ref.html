  <h1> WeakRef Objects </h1>
  <p>
    A WeakRef is an object that is used to refer to a target object
    without preserving it from garbage collection. WeakRefs can
    dereference to allow access to the target object, if the target
    object hasn't been reclaimed by garbage collection.

    <p>The WeakRef constructor:</p>

        constructors that intend to inherit the specified `WeakRef`
        behaviour must include a `super` call to the `WeakRef` constructor
        to create and initialize the subclass instance with the internal

        If the WeakRef returns a _target_ Object that is not

        read consistency is maintained.
