  <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-processing-model">
    <h1>Processing model of WeakRefs and FinalizationGroups</h1>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-invariants">
      <h1>Objectives</h1>

      <p>
        This specification does not make any guarantees about garbage collection.
        Objects which are unreachable from ECMAScript may be released after long periods
        of time, or never at all. For this reason, this specification uses the term
        "may" when describing behavior triggered by garbage collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The semantics of WeakRefs and FinalizationGroups is based on two
        operations which happen at particular points in time:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When WeakRef.prototype.deref is called, the referent (if it's not
          already dead) is kept alive so that subsequent, synchronous accesses also
          return the object. This list is reset when synchronous work is done using
          the ClearKeptObjects abstract operation.
        </li>

        <li>
          When an object which is registered with a FinalizationGroup becomes
          unreachable, a call of the FinalizationGroup's cleanup callback may
          eventually be made, after synchronous ECMAScript execution completes.
          The FinalizationGroup cleanup is performed with the
          CleanupFinalizationGroup abstract operation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Neither of these actions (ClearKeptObjects or CleanupFinalizationGroup)
        may interrupt synchronous ECMAScript execution. Because embedding
        environments may assemble longer, synchronous ECMAScript execution runs,
        this specification defers the scheduling of ClearKeptObjects and
        CleanupFinalizationGroup to the embedding environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some ECMAScript implementations include garbage collector implementations
        which run in the background, including when ECMAScript is idle. Letting the
        embedding environment schedule CleanupFinalizationGroup allows it to resume
        ECMAScript execution in order to run finalizer work, which may free up holdings,
        reducing overall memory usage.
      </p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-liveness">
      <h1>Liveness</h1>

      <p>
        For some object _obj_, a <dfn>hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious</dfn>
        execution with respect to _obj_ is an execution whereby
        WeakRef.prototype.deref being called on a WeakRef whose referent is
        _obj_ always returns *undefined*.
      </p>
      <emu-note>
        WeakRef-obliviousness, together with liveness, capture two
        notions. One, that a WeakRef itself does not keep an object alive. Two,
        that cycles in liveness does not imply that an object is live. To be
        concrete, if determining _obj_'s liveness depends on determining the
        liveness of another WeakRef referent, _obj2_, _obj2_'s liveness cannot
        assume _obj_'s liveness, which would beg the question.
      </emu-note>

      <p>
        At any point during evaluation, an object _obj_ is
        considered <dfn>live</dfn> if either of the following conditions is
        met:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>_obj_ is included in any agent's [[KeptAlive]] List.</li>
        <li>
          There exists a valid future hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution
          with respect to _obj_ that observes the Object value of _obj_.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <emu-note>
        The intuition the second condition above intends to capture is that an
        object is live if its identity is observable via non-WeakRef means. An
        object's identity may be observed by observing a strict equality
        comparison between objects or observing the object being used as key in
        a Map.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Presence of an object in a field, an internal slot, or a property does
        not imply that the object is live. For example if the object in
        question is never passed back to the program, then it cannot be
        observed.

        This is the case for keys in a WeakMap, members of a WeakSet, as well
        as the [[Target]] and [[UnregisterToken]] fields of a FinalizationGroup
        Cell record.

        The above definition implies that, if a key in a WeakMap is not live,
        then its corresponding value is not necessarily live either.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Liveness is the lower bound for guaranteeing which WeakRefs that
        engines must not empty. In practice, liveness as defined here is
        undecidable and engines use conservative approximations. There is
        expected to be significant implementation leeway.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note type=editor>
        The exact definition of liveness remains under discussion in
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs/issues/115">#115</a>.
      </p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-execution">
      <h1>Execution</h1>

      <p>At any time, if an object _obj_ is not live, an ECMAScript implementation may perform the following steps atomically:</p>

      <emu-alg>
        1. For each WeakRef _ref_ such that _ref_.[[Target]] is _obj_,
          1. Set _ref_.[[Target]] to ~empty~.
        1. For each FinalizationGroup _fg_ such that _fg_.[[Cells]] contains _cell_, such that _cell_.[[Target]] is _obj_,
          1. Set _cell_.[[Target]] to ~empty~.
          1. Optionally, perform ! HostCleanupFinalizationGroup(_fg_).
        1. For each WeakMap _map_ such that _map_.[[WeakMapData]] contains a record _r_ such that _r_.[[Key]] is _obj_,
          1. Remove _r_ from _map_.[[WeakMapData]].
        1. For each WeakSet _set_ such that _set_.[[WeakSetData]] contains _obj_,
          1. Remove _obj_ from _set_.[[WeakSetData]].
      </emu-alg>

      <emu-note>
        Together with the definition of liveness, this clause prescribes legal
        optimizations that an implementation may apply regarding WeakRefs.

        It is possible to access an object without observing its
        identity. Optimizations such as dead variable elimination, and scalar
        replacement on properties of non-escaping objects whose identity is not
        observed, are allowed. These optimizations are thus allowed to
        observably empty WeakRefs that point to such objects.

        On the other hand, if an object's identity is observable, and that
        object is in the [[Target]] internal slot of a WeakRef, optimizations
        such as rematerialization that observably empty the WeakRef are
        prohibited.

        <p>
          HostCleanupFinalizationGroup is an implementation-defined abstract

          some point in the future, if possible. The host's responsibility is to

      When the abstract operation
      KeepDuringJob is called with a target object reference, it adds the
