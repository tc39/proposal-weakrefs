  <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-processing-model">
    <h1>Processing model of WeakRefs and FinalizationGroups</h1>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-invariants">
      <h1>Objectives</h1>

      <p>
        This specification does not make any guarantees about garbage collection.
        Objects which are unreachable from ECMAScript may be released after long periods
        of time, or never at all. For this reason, this specification uses the term
        "may" when describing behavior triggered by garbage collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The semantics of WeakRefs and FinalizationGroups is based on two
        operations which happen at particular points in time:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When WeakRef.prototype.deref is called, the referent (if it's not
          already dead) is kept alive so that subsequent, synchronous accesses also
          return the object. This list is reset when synchronous work is done using
          the ClearKeptObjects abstract operation.
        </li>

        <li>
          When an object which is registered with a FinalizationGroup becomes
          unreachable, a call of the FinalizationGroup's cleanup callback may
          eventually be made, after synchronous ECMAScript execution completes.
          The FinalizationGroup cleanup is performed with the
          CleanupFinalizationGroup abstract operation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Neither of these actions (ClearKeptObjects or CleanupFinalizationGroup)
        may interrupt synchronous ECMAScript execution. Because embedding
        environments may assemble longer, synchronous ECMAScript execution runs,
        this specification defers the scheduling of ClearKeptObjects and
        CleanupFinalizationGroup to the embedding environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some ECMAScript implementations include garbage collector implementations
        which run in the background, including when ECMAScript is idle. Letting the
        embedding environment schedule CleanupFinalizationGroup allows it to resume
        ECMAScript execution in order to run finalizer work, which may free up holdings,
        reducing overall memory usage.
      </p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-liveness">
      <h1>Liveness</h1>

      An object _obj_ is considered <dfn>live</dfn> if the following conditions
      are met:

      <ul>
        <li>_obj_ is included in any agent's [[KeptAlive]] List.</li>
        <li>
          Any possible future execution of the program could observably
          reference _obj_, except through a chain of references which
          includes a [[Target]] field of a FinalizationGroup's [[Cells]] List,
          or the [[Target]] internal slot of a WeakRef.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <emu-note>
        The above definition implies that, if a key in a WeakMap is not live,
        then its corresponding value is not necessarily live either. Presence
        of an object as a key in a WeakMap or a member of a WeakSet does not
        imply that the object is live.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note type=editor>
        The exact definition of liveness remains under discussion in
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs/issues/115">#115</a>.
      </p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-execution">
      <h1>Execution</h1>

      <p>
        At any time, an ECMAScript implementation may perform any of the three
        following actions. They may be triggered interspersed with ECMAScript
        code execution, or, e.g., from a separate parallel thread.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If an object is not live, then the implementation may replace any
          reference to the object from the [[Target]] field of a
          FinalizationGroup's [[Cells]] List, or the [[Target]] internal slot
          of a WeakRef, to the value ~empty~.
        </li>
        <li>
          When there is a FinalizationGroup _fg_ such that
          CheckForEmptyCells(_fg_) is *true*, the implementation may perform
          HostCleanupFinalizationGroup(_fg_).

        <p>
          HostCleanupFinalizationGroup is an implementation-defined abstract
          operation that is expected to call CleanupFinalizationGroup(_fg_) at
          some point in the future, if possible. The host's responsibility is to
          make this call at a time which does not interrupt synchronous
          ECMAScript code execution.

      ECMAScript implementations are expected to call ClearKeptObjects when a
      synchronous sequence of ECMAScript execution completes.

    <p>The following steps are performed:</p>

    </emu-alg>
    <emu-note>
      When the abstract operation
      KeepDuringJob is called with a target object reference, it adds the
      target to an identity Set that will point strongly at the target until
      the end of the current Job. This may be abstractly implemented as a
      Set in the current Job that becomes unreachable when the Job ends
      because the Job becomes unreachable, or as a Set in the current Agent
      that gets cleared at the end of each Job.
